<strong>Andersson, Julius J.</strong> The Distributional Effects of a Carbon Tax on Gasoline: The Role of Income Inequality <a href="https://www.juliusandersson.com/The_Distributional_Effects_of_a_Carbon_Tax_February_2022.pdf" target="_blank">(link)</a>

We present a simple model that shows how the two parameters of income inequality and the income elasticity of demand determine changes in the distributional effect of a consumption tax; with rising inequality increasing the regressivity of a consumption tax on necessities. We test the model's predictions by analysing the Swedish carbon tax on transport fuel. We find that the tax is increasingly regressive over time, which is highly correlated with a rise in income inequality, and that the tax incidence moves from regressive to progressive when switching from annual income to the more evenly distributed measure of lifetime income.

<p><strong>Andersson, Julius J.</strong> The "Meatigation" of Climate Change: Environmental and Distributional Effects of a Greenhouse Gas Tax on Animal Food Products</p>

<div style="text-align: justify">
Livestock products are responsible for just under 15 percent of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and are thereby a major contributor to climate change. Furthermore, estimated emission reductions from improved productivity and livestock management will be cancelled out by growth in livestock numbers since global demand for animal food products is estimated to almost double by 2050. Consequently, a more efficient mitigation approach is to reduce emissions through efforts to lower consumption. This study analyses the climate change mitigation potential, welfare, and distributional effects of a greenhouse gas consumption tax on animal food products in Sweden. The results show that a tax set at the level of 1180 SEK ($130) per ton of carbon dioxide equivalents will reduce annual emissions from food consumption by 6-10 percent depending on the number of animal food products that are taxed. Additionally, the distributional effect will be proportional when measured against lifetime income but regressive when measured against annual income, and with diverse impacts on changes in diets dependent on disposable income. These findings indicate that the tax will be environmentally efficient but <i>how</i> it is implemented is crucial for its acceptance among the general public.
